        h1 SWR Ranges

        p
            b SWR 1.0 &#8594; 1.5:
            br
            | Correct operating range to aim for. Normal radios
            | can handle this fine without issue. I can't
            | speak for QRP homebrew tranceivers.

        p
            b SWR 1.5 &#8594; 1.9:
            br
            | Doesn't seem to bother the radio, but is less
            | efficient. On an analyzer sweep, I count less
            | than 2:1 as the bandwith of the antenna.

        p
            b SWR 2 &#8594; 2.4:
            br
            | Ok on the radio for lighter use. Even
            | less efficient transfer of power. Finals
            | will heat a bit more. Ok for something like
            | a net or a 3/4 person round, but if running 
            | FT8 or other digi modes watts and heat should 
            | be monitored. Decrease power as needed and
            | leverage the weak signal properties of the FT8
            | and similar modes. Setup can likely be improved.

        p
            b SWR 2.5 &#8594; 2.9:
            br
            | Not good. Will heat finals. Can damage radio
            | with frequent use or 50/50 convo w/lots of
            | talking. Fix setup or use a tuner/match.

        p
            b SWR 3.0 or higher:
            br
            | Do NOT transmit for any extended amount of
            | time. Likely to damage finals (can blow finals
            | at higher power). The only time this is ok
            | is during tuning with a manual tuner. 
            | Even then, power should not any higher than 
            | what the tuner/meter needs for a good reading.
            | If having trouble tuning, give frequent breaks. 
            | Quick PTTs only.
