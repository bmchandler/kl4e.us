Welcome to the repo of my personal amateur radio static site. The site itself
is built from the code in this repo and output to the 'html' directory. I write
the website content via the Pug and Sass languages. These are these are then
built/transpiled into HTML & CSS respectively in the 'html' directory. The reason
I'm trying hosting it here is because Codespaces is now available. Update to the
'html' directory on a fresh build automatically triggers GitHub Pages to update
the live site. That said, if you use my build code, the 'html' contents is
effectively live on commit.

My Static Website Build Code for building the static site is free to use under
the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Intl. License. I still retain all rights on the static site
Content created by me. The intent is to allow others (particularly amateur radio 
operators) to reuse the structure of this repo and the site building code for their
own personal website if they so desire.
