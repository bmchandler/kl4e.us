Normal radios
can handle this fine without issue. I can't
speak for QRP homebrew tranceivers.</p><p><b>SWR 1.5 &#8594; 1.9:</b><br>Doesn't seem to bother the radio, but is less
efficient. On an analyzer sweep, I count less
than 2:1 as the bandwith of the antenna.</p><p><b>SWR 2 &#8594; 2.4:</b><br>Ok on the radio for lighter use. Even
less efficient transfer of power. Finals
will heat a bit more. Ok for something like
a net or a 3/4 person round, but if running 
FT8 or other digi modes watts and heat should 
be monitored. Decrease power as needed and
leverage the weak signal properties of the FT8
and similar modes. Setup can likely be improved.</p><p><b>SWR 2.5 &#8594; 2.9:</b><br>Not good. Will heat finals. Can damage radio
with frequent use or 50/50 convo w/lots of
talking. Fix setup or use a tuner/match.</p><p><b>SWR 3.0 or higher:</b><br>Do NOT transmit for any extended amount of
time. Likely to damage finals (can blow finals
at higher power). The only time this is ok
is during tuning with a manual tuner. 
Even then, power should not any higher than 
what the tuner/meter needs for a good reading.
If having trouble tuning, give frequent breaks.
