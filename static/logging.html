Coming into this hobby in 2021, there was a dizzying array of options and thoughts. It was definately a pain point for me starting out and got in the way of tinkering and learning. Thankfully, it's not legally required by the FCC anymore which gives us flexibility there. In the end, however, I couldn't get around logging so I sat down and tried to think up a modern approach that didn't drain the fun. Below is how I currently log, but also when I incorporated it into my activities. </p><h3>A Note About Linux <br>(Windows ham software is mostly too much trouble to get working on linux).</h3><p>I only use Linux short my work and gaming PC. I've been using Linux since probably back in the early 90's and before that some UNIX. For ham operations, I run LMDE. On fresh install of LMDE, you have the support of the Linux Mint team, but the rock solid core of Debian Stable. Right after install, all you have to do is an initial update, run a terminal, and with root privs. `apt install hamradio`. Many common (probably the most common) ham radio tools for linux are part of that metapackage and install at one go. You will probably want to press the Escape key when the dialog asks to configure some clock thing. It will mess with how the system keeps time. You very likely don't want that and can configure it later if you do. Personally, I feel it should be dropped from the metapackage.</p><h3>A Note About ADIF (Amateur Data Interchage Format)</h3><p>If the logging software doesn't support it, don't bother with it. Go to <a href="https://www.adif.org">adif.org</a> for more info.</p><h4>2 Meters</h4><p>Around here, 2m activity is mostly in the evenings around 7p when the local nets start firing up and everyone is off work and done eating. I don't log 2m, however, I have recently started using cue cards to help me keep track of a round after the nets. Sometimes also to help me track the net while waiting my turn on a large one. Sometimes I jot some notes down from the discussion. After no longer useful, trash it.</p><h4>Hamshack Activity (Paper Log)</h4><p>Since I have dedicated and area as my hamshack, my first log was to answer a very simple question: 'Was I in my shack doing anything radio related?' Any small book will do. I do date+day, IN time, OUT time, and either a note of NT for No Transmit or something like Start Time, 20m, FT8, 60W, End Time. The thinking was, if anyone complained, I at least had a record of when I was physically near my equipment and an idea of what time ranges anything was known to be tranmitting.</p><h4>HF FT8 (Digital Log)</h4><p>FT8 was the first digital logging I bothered with. Computer logging is really where the logging rabbit hole starts because it's most common at the time of this writing to upload logs to sites like QRZ, eQSL, and LOTW. I'll go into tradeoffs on those later on this page. WSJT-X will automatically keep it's own log and create an ADIF file to go with that. Starting out, you can use that ADIF file to upload to any online logging site or any local logging software. If using KLog (which I still recommend despite the following), I'm still having trouble getting KLog and GridTracker to both play nice, so on nights I use GridTracker, I manually import into KLog instead of having it connect to WSJT-X and log automatically from WSJT-X.</p><h4>HF Logging (Digital Log)</h4><p>After installing and messing with the few common Linux logs available, I settled on KLog. KLog comes already installed with the 'hamradio' meta package, so that can't be easier with LMDE. Some logs on linux only seemed work easily with multiple online services. This have support for 4, but 3 of those is QRZ, eQSL, and LOTW. Theses are the only 3 I bother with so it's an easy pick for a local log that will sync with those with minimal setup. I do not contest and prefer more casual, relaxed, interactions if not something like FT8. That said, I will probably continue with paper log for the SSB contacts and make entering and uploading part of my wrap-up routine for the shack.</p><h4>Sharing Logs (QRZ, eQSL, LOTW)</h4><p>Sharing Logs was (and still is) the trickiest thing for me to get done the way I want. There are common fields in ADIF format that tend to be used, but there are more available that can/could have been. I really wish all online logging platform had a "Setup Sandbox" that wouldn't try to verify contacts, etc. just for getting things right. Recently on QRZ I was trying to delete a test only to find out something had already verified and I couldn't fix/delete it without jumping through some hoops. I don't know how it happened, but since then I've added in the use of the `ADIF Master` software. It is not a Linux program (unfortunately), but I can confirm it's simple enough to run in Wine on Linux. ADIF Master will allow you to look at ADIF files like a spreadsheet, what columns they were generated with, and a chance to make corrections before loading them into local logs or external logs.</p><p>QRZ, eQSL, and LOTW are the main online logs used at this time. Each has their focus and pros-cons. I'm not going to go into that, but in the end you probably will want to pay for QRZ or eQSL. QRZ is kinda like Facebook with public contact logs. eQSL is more like a digital alternative to paper QSL cards with public logs. LOTW is the long standing log used for contesting and ARRL awards. LOTW is showing it's age at the time of this writing, but if you are going to contest, you'll eventually probably have to use it. It is more difficult to get going though because of the verification process and requirement of using signed keys and software that can't be integrated directly into a logging program.</p><p>The way the above 3 played out for me was... I only did FT8 until I got some digital logging setup locally on KLog. Then I worked on getting it uploading to eQSL (free). After a while I got QRZ going, but couldn't upload to it (not free). It did help confirm contacts locally though from people that use it. Finally, I got through the drawn out LOTW process. LOTW doesn't store enough details on the sync, so I wouldn't recommend it as a natural backup. After probably a year of tinkering with both QRZ and eQSL I ended up paying for QRZ. Even though eQSL is looking a little dated, pros and cons of each are still worth taking time on and digging into before paying. It was a realy, and I mean really, hard call for which subscription I was ok commiting to. If you don't care about a Facebook type page and just want a place to back-up and verify logs at, eQSL ends up slightly cheaper at time of this writing and much cheaper compounded. If you can budget for more per month/year for one of the two services and want to use their awards though, QRZ gives a darn good bang for buck. Today's date is March 31st, 2023 for staleness check to above.</p><h4>POTA (Parks on the Air) Logging</h4><p>POTA is a great activity if you still aren't using (or don't tend to like) digital logging because you can be a Hunter and hunt the activators at the parks from the comfort of your home. Activators, not Hunters, are responsible for all logging to the POTA site. This has been great for me getting over mic shy on SSB. </p><p>I have not activated yet at the time of this writing, but if you decide to become an Activator later you have several logging options since recent updates and 3rd-party software releases. If you want to paper log at the park and enter it direct into website, you can now. If you want to add them to KLog and export them to ADIF for bulk upload you can do that also. They do have specific ADIF fields used, so you could use 'ADIF Master' to prep the file or tweak the file in a text editor before uploading it. More recently many have taken to using a POTA focussed logging software called HAMRS. It runs on LMDE as an AppImage. It can sync with the POTA site right away and is easy to use once installed.</p><footer><a href="index.html">Home</a></footer></body></html>
